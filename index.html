      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Cell division is an essential biological process that occupies a central role in a cell’s life. From its birth to its eventual death, it enables the formation of two new cells that may or may not be genetically identical to their original mother cell. At the multicellular level, cell division allows organisms to grow, repair tissue, and reproduce. Without it, life as we know it would cease to exist. To understand how division preserves or alters genetic information, it’s first necessary to look at chromosomes.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Chromosomes</h2>
      <p>
        Let’s break down what a chromosome really is. It all starts with DNA—short for deoxyribonucleic acid. This molecule carries all the instructions that make an organism function, from its appearance to how its cells operate. DNA is double-stranded, like a twisted ladder, and not easy to organize or move inside a cell.
      </p>
      <p>
        That’s where histones come in. These special proteins act like spools that DNA winds around, forming bead-like structures called nucleosomes. When these nucleosomes coil together, they form a dense fiber called chromatin. When chromatin coils even tighter, the familiar chromosome shape emerges.

      <h2>Interphase</h2>
      <p>
        Before diving into cell division itself, it’s crucial to understand interphase—the stage where the cell spends most of its life. Here, the cell grows, performs normal functions, and prepares for division. Interphase has three main parts: G₁, S, and G₂.
      </p>

      <h3>G₁ Phase</h3>
      <p>
        The cell gears up for DNA replication. Each chromosome exists as a single, unreplicated structure. The duration of G₁ varies widely—some cells breeze through in hours, others linger for weeks. Occasionally, a cell enters a resting state called G₀, remaining metabolically active but not dividing. To return to G₁, it requires specific chemical signals.
      </p>

      <h3>S Phase</h3>
      <p>
        DNA replication takes place here. Each chromosome duplicates, producing two identical sister chromatids joined at a centromere. The chromosome becomes a bichromatid structure, poised for future separation.
      </p>

      <h3>G₂ Phase</h3>
      <p>
        The cell now prepares for division by synthesizing proteins and components like microtubules, essential for chromosome movement. It’s the final checkpoint before mitosis begins.

      <h2>Mitosis</h2>
      <h3>Role</h3>
      <p>
        Mitosis is the process by which a single mother cell divides to produce two genetically identical daughter cells. It enables growth, tissue repair, and cell replacement in multicellular organisms.
      </p>


      <h3>Phases of Mitosis</h3>

      <h4>Prophase</h4>
      <p>
        During Prophase, the chromatin fibers condense into distinct, visible chromosomes. Each chromosome is made of two identical sister chromatids joined by the centromere. The nucleus gradually disappears as the nuclear envelope breaks down, allowing the genetic material to freely flow in the cytoplasm. Meanwhile, the centrosomes migrate to opposite sides of the cell and form a mitotic spindle, a structure of microtubules that will move the chromosomes later on. This stage sets the foundation for the entire division.
      </p>
      <img src="Screenshot 2025-11-12 113129.png" alt="Prophase diagram" />

      <h4>Metaphase</h4>
      <p>
        Here, the fully condensed chromosomes arrange themselves along the equatorial plane, a vertical line that passes through the center, also called the metaphase plate. Each chromosome is connected to the spindle fibers via its kinetochore, a protein structure located at the centromere. This symmetrical alignment ensures that, during the next phase, each new cell will have an identical set of chromosomes. This phase is the easiest to identify under a microscope because of this arrangement.
      </p>
      <img src="Screenshot 2025-11-12 114356.png" alt="Metaphase diagram" />

      <h4>Anaphase</h4>
      <p>
        Anaphase is where sister chromatids separate and move toward opposite poles. The centromeres divide, and the spindle fibers shorten, pulling each chromatid to a pole. Once separated, each chromatid is considered an individual chromosome, which brings us back to how they were in the G2 phase of Interphase. This helps ensure that the new cells will have the same, complete set of genetic material. The cell itself elongates, guided by the spindle apparatus, preparing for the final step of division. Anaphase is a rapid phase where genetic equality is assured.
      </p>

      <h4>Telophase</h4>
      <p>
        During Telophase, the chromosomes reach the opposite poles and begin to uncoil back into their original chromatin form, losing their condensed shape. New nuclear envelopes appear encircling the new sets of chromosomes, restoring the nuclei. The nucleolus reappears, and the spindle fibers disintegrate. This stage restores the cell’s normal internal structures, signaling the end of nuclear division. Cytokinesis, the splitting of cytoplasm, ensures the creation of two distinct daughter cells, genetically identical.

      <h2>Meiosis</h2>
      <h3>Role</h3>
      <p>
        Meiosis is the second type of cell division, and unlike mitosis, it doesn’t create identical daughter cells. Its main job is to produce gametes (sperm and egg cells for humans), which carry only half the usual amount of genetic material. This reduction is crucial because, when a sperm and an egg fuse during fertilization, the embryo needs to start with the normal chromosome number, not double.
        What really makes meiosis special is the way it introduces genetic diversity. During Prophase I, homologous chromosomes, pairs that have the same genes but not always the same alleles, line up and exchange pieces in a process called crossing over. This swaps segments of DNA between them, creating new combinations of alleles that didn’t exist before. Later, in Metaphase I, the homologous chromosomes line up randomly, a phenomenon called independent assortment. This randomness controls which chromosomes end up together in each gamete. Together, these two events make sure that each gamete is genetically unique. This helps keep populations diverse, adaptable, and capable of evolving. Meiosis doesn’t just ensure a species’ survival; it also ensures its ability to thrive through all the changes in its habitat.
      </p>
      <h3>Genes, Alleles, homologous chromsomes</h3>
     <p>Genes are segments of chromosomes that determine specific traits or functions. Alleles represent the alternative forms of a gene, and homologous chromosomes are pairs of chromosomes that carry the same genes in the same order.</p>

      <h3>Phases of Meiosis</h3>
      <p>
        Meiosis consists of two successive divisions: Meiosis I, which separates homologous chromosomes, and Meiosis II, which separates sister chromatids, resulting in four haploid daughter cells.
      </p>

      <h4>Meiosis I</h4>
      <p>
        Meiosis I is the first division in meiosis. It passes through four phases with names similar to mitosis, but the events are quite different.
      </p>

      <h4>Prophase I</h4>
      <p>
        The homologous chromosomes pair up to form tetrads, which are basically two chromosomes made of four chromatids sitting tightly together. This close pairing allows crossing over to happen. Aside from that, many steps resemble mitotic prophase: the chromosomes condense, the nuclear envelope breaks down, and the spindle begins to form.
      </p>
      <img src="Screenshot 2025-11-14 112400.png" alt="Prophase I">

      <h4>Metaphase I</h4>
      <p>
        Here is the big twist. The tetrads line up at the equator, not individual chromosomes like in mitosis. Since the cell separates whole homologous chromosomes instead of chromatids, each new cell ends up with only one chromosome from each pair. This means each daughter cell carries only one allele for each gene. At this stage, the cell becomes haploid.
      </p>
      <img src="Screenshot 2025-11-14 112630.png" alt="Metaphase I">

      <h4>Anaphase I and Telophase I</h4>
      <p>
        These phases feel similar to mitosis, but what is being separated is different. Instead of pulling sister chromatids apart, the cell pulls homologous chromosomes toward opposite poles. Telophase I completes the division as the chromosomes gather at each end, and cytokinesis usually produces two haploid daughter cells. Each of these cells still contains duplicated chromosomes, but only half the original genetic content.
      </p>
      <img src="Screenshot 2025-11-14 112706.png" alt="Anaphase I & Telophase I">

      <h3>Meiosis II</h3>
      <p>
        This second division basically picks up where Meiosis I left off. The cells are already haploid, so each chromosome is made of two sister chromatids. The goal now is to separate those chromatids.
      </p>

      <h4>Prophase II</h4>
      <p>
        The spindle starts to form again, and the nuclear envelope, if it was ever rebuilt, breaks down. The chromosomes are already condensed or got condensed again during the small break between the two divisions.
      </p>
      <img src="Screenshot 2025-11-14 115448.png" alt="Prophase II">

      <h4>Metaphase II</h4>
      <p>
        Now the chromosomes line up at the center of the cell. This part really does look a lot like mitosis. Each chromosome gets attached to spindle fibers from opposite sides, so they can be pulled apart in the next phase.
      </p>
      <img src="Screenshot 2025-11-14 115534.png" alt="Metaphase II">

      <h4>Anaphase II</h4>
      <p>
        This is where the action happens. The sister chromatids finally separate and move to opposite poles. These chromatids now count as individual chromosomes, so the chromosome number stays haploid even though the chromatids are splitting.
      </p>
      <img src="Screenshot 2025-11-14 115639.png" alt="Anaphase II">

      <h4>Telophase II</h4>
      <p>
        Everything winds down. The chromatids reach the poles, the nuclear envelope reforms, and the chromosomes start relaxing back into chromatin. Cytokinesis follows, splitting each cell into two. By the end of all this, we end up with four haploid cells, each one genetically different from the others. And that’s the whole point: variation.
      </p>
