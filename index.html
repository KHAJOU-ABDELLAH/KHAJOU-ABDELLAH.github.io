      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Cell division is an essential biological process that occupies a central role in a cell’s life. From its birth to its eventual death, it enables the formation of two new cells that may or may not be genetically identical to their original mother cell. At the multicellular level, cell division allows organisms to grow, repair tissue, and reproduce. Without it, life as we know it would cease to exist. To understand how division preserves or alters genetic information, it’s first necessary to look at chromosomes.
      </p>

      <h2>Chromosomes</h2>
      <p>
        Let’s break down what a chromosome really is. It all starts with DNA—short for deoxyribonucleic acid. This molecule carries all the instructions that make an organism function, from its appearance to how its cells operate. DNA is double-stranded, like a twisted ladder, and not easy to organize or move inside a cell.
      </p>
      <p>
        That’s where histones come in. These special proteins act like spools that DNA winds around, forming bead-like structures called nucleosomes. When these nucleosomes coil together, they form a dense fiber called chromatin. When chromatin coils even tighter, the familiar chromosome shape emerges.

      <h2>Interphase</h2>
      <p>
        Before diving into cell division itself, it’s crucial to understand interphase—the stage where the cell spends most of its life. Here, the cell grows, performs normal functions, and prepares for division. Interphase has three main parts: G₁, S, and G₂.
      </p>

      <h3>G₁ Phase</h3>
      <p>
        The cell gears up for DNA replication. Each chromosome exists as a single, unreplicated structure. The duration of G₁ varies widely—some cells breeze through in hours, others linger for weeks. Occasionally, a cell enters a resting state called G₀, remaining metabolically active but not dividing. To return to G₁, it requires specific chemical signals.
      </p>

      <h3>S Phase</h3>
      <p>
        DNA replication takes place here. Each chromosome duplicates, producing two identical sister chromatids joined at a centromere. The chromosome becomes a bichromatid structure, poised for future separation.
      </p>

      <h3>G₂ Phase</h3>
      <p>
        The cell now prepares for division by synthesizing proteins and components like microtubules, essential for chromosome movement. It’s the final checkpoint before mitosis begins.

      <h2>Mitosis</h2>
      <h3>Role</h3>
      <p>
        Mitosis is the process by which a single mother cell divides to produce two genetically identical daughter cells. It enables growth, tissue repair, and cell replacement in multicellular organisms.
      </p>

      <img src="medium.png" alt="Diagram illustrating stages of mitosis" />

      <h3>Phases of Mitosis</h3>

      <h4>Prophase</h4>
      <p>
       The nuclear envelope breaks down, and the chromatin condenses to become more and more compact and dense, which leads to it being more visible under the mircroscope, The chromosome at this stage consist of identical paired sister chromatids, Centrosomes move to opposite poles.
      </p>
      <img src="Screenshot 2025-11-12 113129.png" alt="Prophase diagram" />

      <h4>Metaphase</h4>
      <p>
       Chromosomes, now in their bichromatid state,  move along to the equatorial plane, where they all line up vertically, each side of the chromosome gets attached to the kinetochore microtubules and are at this point ready to be separated in the next phase.
      </p>
      <img src="Screenshot 2025-11-12 114356.png" alt="Metaphase diagram" />

      <h4>Anaphase</h4>
      <p>
        Sister chromatids separate and move toward opposite poles of the cell, ensuring each new nucleus receives a full set of chromosomes.
      </p>
      <img src="Screenshot 2025-11-12 114753.png" alt="Anaphase diagram" />

      <h4>Telophase</h4>
      <p>
        Chromosomes arrive at opposite poles and begin to de-condense into chromatin. New nuclear envelopes form around each set, creating two nuclei. This marks the end of nuclear division and is followed by cytokinesis, the physical splitting of the cytoplasm into two daughter cells.

      <h2>Meiosis</h2>
      <h3>Role</h3>
      <p>
        Meiosis is the type of cell division that produces gametes—sperm and egg cells—with half the chromosome number of the original cell. This reduction is essential for sexual reproduction, ensuring genetic diversity through recombination and independent assortment.
      </p>

      <h3>Phases of Meiosis</h3>
      <p>
        Meiosis consists of two successive divisions: Meiosis I, which separates homologous chromosomes, and Meiosis II, which separates sister chromatids—resulting in four haploid daughter cells.
      </p>

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        Both mitosis and meiosis are essential to life. Mitosis sustains growth and repair by producing identical cells, while meiosis ensures diversity and continuity of species. Together, they form the foundation of biological development and inheritance.
